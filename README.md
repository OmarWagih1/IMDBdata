# IMDBdata

### This is a project that scrapes IMDB for the top 250 movies, gets all kinds of data from them (title, Lead actor, second actor, director
### writer, budget, usa gross, year, runtime, imdb id) by scraping the page of every movie in IMDB, it then stores them into a dataframe
### and there's a file that edits the dataframe's budget column to include currency adjusted to dollars with the daily rate.


## Disclaimer: I don't know if imdb allows scraping or not. The usage of these scripts and the data is at your own risk.
